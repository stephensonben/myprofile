                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">This project aims to create a website for a Victorian local government client that will allow staff to easily extract information about landholders for emergency management purposes. Where possible free and open-source software (FOSS) will be used to keep costs down and allow for simple implementation in other organisations.
<br><br>Staff will be presented with a map, centered on the municipality, where they can define their area of interest, select the output filetype and click a button to extract ratepayer information. The ease of use of this website will reduce the reliance on specialised geographic information system (GIS) staff and result in more timely responses in an emergency.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5"><em>Motivation</em></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">All Councils are required to store the names and contact information of owners and ratepayers for every property that is in their municipality. In an emergency this information has to be supplied to various agencies like the police and SES. 
<br><br>In smaller councils the responsibility often falls to one person to maintain all the GIS software and in the event of an emergency provide data to emergency services. Due to this overreliance on individuals, there is the very real possibility that should that person be unavailable a council would not be able to supply the required information and lives could be put at risk.&nbsp;<br></p>

    <div class="container align-center">
        <div class="row justify-content-md-center">
            <div class="mbr-white col-md-10">
                
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5"><em>Description</em></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Upon opening the website users will be presented with a map as the focal point of the screen. The map will use the OpenLayers library for rendering and Open Street Map (OSM) layers will be used as the default base layer with the option of turning on aerial photography hosted by the municipality. <br>
<br>There will be the option to draw points, lines or polygons and buffer them as well as the ability to import files that have been supplied by external agencies e.g. a fire footprint supplied by the CFA could be imported.
<br><br>The site will be hosted on a Windows Server machine using IIS as this is the most prevalent configuration in local government and ensures existing system administration staff can easily maintain the site. Initially there would be no security on the website as it would be for internal use only but should the need arise for users to access it externally an Active Directory integrated login page could be developed.
<br><br>The first step for the user will be to define their area of interest by either drawing it on the map with the tools provided or by uploading a file. Most standard geospatial filetypes will be supported for upload as processing will be handled using the GeoAlchemy and Fiona libraries for python.
<br><br>Once the area required has been uploaded or drawn, the user will need to select the output filetype they desire. To avoid unnecessarily complicating the process, only ESRI shapefile or a CSV with a geometry column will be supported as these formats are supported in all modern GIS software.  The user will then select whether they would like a direct download or to have the results emailed to themselves.
<br><br>When the user hits the process button the parameters selected will be passed to python where the Shapely library will be used to perform an intersection operation on the geometry created on the website and the geometry of the ratepayer information in a PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS extension enabled.
<br><br>The ratepayer information in the database will have been populated from merging the geometry from a state government supplied cadastral layer with the data from Councils property database. The database table will contain whatever contact information Council has recorded against each property. Whilst this project focuses on loading data from one vendors database it would be quite simple to modify it to work with a different vendor. <br>
<br>The information that was requested would then be returned to the user in the requested format for distribution to other agencies.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5"><em>Skills required</em></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">In addition to an understanding of the fundamentals of GIS some level of proficiency will be required in the following programming languages: HTML, Javascript, Python and SQL.
<br><br>The website itself will use a mixture of HTML and Javascript to render the map and provide the user with the tools to create a geometry and specify their desired output. Python will handle the data manipulation using the GeoAlchemy, Fiona and Shapely libraries in conjunction with the PostgreSQL database.
<br><br>The server that it runs on will be virtualised and will need to be setup with someone with a knowledge of virtualisation, Windows Server technology, Windows networking and a basic understanding of Microsoft IIS.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5"><em>Overview</em></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">If the project was successfully implemented, Council would have a way to easily extract information required in an emergency without relying on any particular staff member. As open-source software has been used as much as possible there is very little cost of implementation making it an attractive proposition. <br>
<br>With some slight modification the project could quite easily be packaged up and deployed in other local government organisations to also help them better respond in emergencies. It could also be extended to provide a self-service download option for any other number of datasets that councils collect information on like roads, footpaths and drainage.&nbsp;<br></p>
